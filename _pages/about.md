I am Arash, a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/inet-tuberlin/">INET</a> research group at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, working under the supervision of <a href="https://schmiste.github.io/">Prof. Stefan Schmid</a>. I am also an associated researcher with <a href="https://plamadiso.weizenbaum-institut.de">PLAMADISO</a>
research group at the <a href="https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en">Weizenbaum Institute</a> for the Networked Society.
Previously I was a researcher at the University of Vienna and completed research internships at IST Austria and CUHK Hong Kong. I am interested in algorithm design and analysis with applications in networks, distributed systems, and blockchains. My particular focus is on [self-adjusting networks](https://self-adjusting.net/).

Throughout the years, [my publications](/research)  gathered [250+ citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jsHuvKEAAAAJ&hl=en), and I have been delighted to be a mentor for [more than 15 students](/supervision) from across the world. I have been involved in teaching advanced theoretical and practical algorithmic concepts for [10 years](/teaching), and I have been active in [community service](/service) to ensure credibility and accessibility of knowledge. 
I will be on the job market in 2025/2026 cycle, feel free to reach out to me via my email:
