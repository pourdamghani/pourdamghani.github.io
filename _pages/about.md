I am a direct Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.inet.tu-berlin.de/menue/internet_network_architectures/">INET</a> group at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/ct/stefan/">Prof. Stefan Schmid</a>.
Previously I was a researcher at the University of Vienna and completed research internships in IST Austria and CUHK Hong Kong.
I got my B.Sc from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran, and I am interested in algorithm design, with applications in networks and blockchains.

Under construction :)
