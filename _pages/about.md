Hi :) I am Arash, a direct Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/inet-tuberlin/">INET</a> group at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, working under the supervision of <a href="https://schmiste.github.io/">Prof. Stefan Schmid</a>.
Previously I was a researcher at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/ct/">University of Vienna</a> and completed research internships in <a href="https://phd.pages.ista.ac.at/isternship/">IST Austria</a> under supervision of <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~kchatterjee/">Prof. Chatterjee</a> and <a href="https://www.summer.cuhk.edu.hk/surp/">CUHK Hong Kong</a> under supervision of <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jcheng/">Prof. Cheng</a>. I got my B.Sc from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran as an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201202100255/http://algorithms.ce.sharif.edu/members?page=2">algorithm's lab</a>.

I am interested in algorithm design and analysis with applications in newtworks, distributed systems and blockchain.
